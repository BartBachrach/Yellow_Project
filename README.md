## Movie Recommendations
Our goal is to produce a tool to recommend lesser-known movies to streaming customers. We will employ a machine-learning model to group movies together based on multivariate factors, including the most relevant genome tag and genre, thus grouping similar movies. Our strategy is to recommend movies to users based on a selection of criteria, and recommend a second movie from the same cluster as an alternative.

## User Interface
We will create a JavaScript file and HTML file that will be hosted on a website with a dropdown menu for a user to select a number of criteria, such as ratings, popularity, and genre. The code will then recommend one popular movie, and one similar, lesser-known movie that the user might enjoy.

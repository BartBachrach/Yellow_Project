## Movie Recommendations
Our goal is to produce a tool to recommend lesser-known movies to streaming customers. We will employ a machine-learning model to group movies together based on keywords, thus grouping similar movies. We will attempt to employ natural language processing to analyze the keywords in the dataset to group similar movies. 

## User Interface
We will create a JavaScript file and HTML file that will be hosted on a website with a dropdown menu for a user to select a number of criteria, such as ratings, popularity, and genre. The code will then recommend one popular movie, and one similar, lesser-known movie that the user might enjoy.

## Movie Recommendations
Our goal is to create a website that makes movie recommendations based on user input. We will employ a machine-learning model to cluster similar movies based on the criteria we choose for the search filters on the website.

## User Interface
We will create a JavaScript file and HTML file that will be hosted on a website with a dropdown menu for a user to select a number of criteria, such as ratings, popularity, and genre. The code will then recommend one popular movie, and one similar, lesser-known movie that the user might enjoy.
